# Organizational Concepts

While organizations are made up of humans, they operate differently than an individual.  These are thoughts gathered around how organizations operate.

### Social vs Organizational Constructs

Don't confuse how an organization is structured (think and org chart) with how it operates.  Structure is excellent at administering an organization, and poor at helping it achieve an objective.  Social constructs achieve results, don't shy away from them.  You can control a structure, but you'll need to influence an social construct.

### The Siren Song of Strandardization

Standardizing for standardization's sake is stupid.  I've been a part of far too many standardization efforts that made it more difficult for people to do their jobs, not less.  Every one of these failed.  Standardization should never be the objective, only the means by which one is achieved. 

### People

When your organization reaches a certain size it specializes in 1 thing; people.  At an executive level, the thing you need to care about most is how you hire them and how you grow them.  Senior Managers can't be involved in all of the individual product decisions.  Focus on hiring really smart people.  Those smart people will solve the problems where they exist; at the ground level.
