# management

This is a repository of things I have found useful in understanding people, their motivations, how they work, and why their contributions are important.

This is broken into the following categories:

1. Frameworks: structures for thinking about how people approach problems
2. Reading: a list of things that are useful to read
3. Concepts: a collection of concepts that are useful in understanding people
4. Lessons: a synopsis of hard lessons I've learned
5. Next Steps: a list of things I want to try next

This isn't an all inclusive list of how and why I manage, but it's a wonderful start.  I hope you find this useful and that it makes your work more fruitful.
