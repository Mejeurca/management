1. We tried that already

   The problems you're likely to work on are hard.  Like, unimagineably hard.  Yes, you're smart, and yes, you've solved hard problems before.  Trust me when I say, the problems in government (our clients) are not like the ones you've worked on in the past.  The technical problem may be quite simple, but you will play in a system.
   
   With that said, lots of smart people have come before you.  Long lines of them.  Some of them were smarter than you are.  The litany of things they attempted is longer than you can imagine.  The dedication they had to solving the problem was pristine.  Every iteration of every solution you can imagine was considered.
   
2. We are the problem
