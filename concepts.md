# Concepts

These are truths I have found as I've operated in large, small, difficult, easy, and unreal environments. 
### There is no room of adults

   You have arrived.  You're now the adult.  While you will perpetually want to turn to someone that knows what the hell is going on, no such person exists.  If you're in the room, everyone else is looking to you for the answer.  Get used to it, it doesn't go away.

### Don't care so much

   Passion is a valuable tool.  It's the thing that gets me out of bed every morning.  It's what causes me to lie awake at 2am thinking about how to solve a problem.  Don't let it tip into obsession.  Passion drives to solutions, Obsession gets stuck on the method by which you arrive at a solution.  Let people find their path to the solution and only intervene when they're about to make a mistake from which they can't recover.
   
### Complexity is always the enemy

   Always.

### Influence over control

   The team you now manage is made up of humans.  Humans with emotions, expections, assumptions and many other things.  You are not likely operating in the military, and even if you were, it's not likely you can control someone.  This isn't a cult, and you're not in the 3rd grade.  You influence people, not control them.  Shape the arc of your engagement with the idea you adjust the vector, not make turns.
   
   The more turns you attempt, the more dissatisfied your staff will be.

### 30 year problems

   Need 30 year fixes.  This hole wan't dug in 6 months and smart people have been working on it for a while.  Keep digging.
