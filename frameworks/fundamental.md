# Fundamental Framework

1. It's about people

   At any given point, the problem you're working on is about people.  They either created it, are working on fixing it, or are the recipients of the fix.  People suck.  They're complex, indecisive, contradictory, and just generally annoying.
   
   Like it or not, they're our customer.  Never get dragged into the fiction that you have a sterile environment.  Understand people's motivations.
   
   A general rule to operate by: there are statistically no people in your workforce who want to do the wrong thing.  There are just people who have different information available to them and different underlying assumptions.

2. It's about doing

   Planing is a good idea, but when it comes to software development, the most important thing you can do is start developing.  Far too often we are caught in all of the reasons why we can't start doing things.  Those reasons will never go away, and they will likely never be resolved, you'll just encounter a point where you are forced to ignore them.  Push through earlier and start.  Set a stupid small goal for what you want to deliver first.  The act of getting started is the important first step.
   
   **Important note**: "discovery sprints" are only a thing for about 2 weeks.  After that, you're in nothing more than the requirements gathering phase of waterfall.
   
3. It's about having a better problem tomorrow

   We didn't create the problem overnight (and if we did, I hope we reverted automatically), and we won't find a solution overnight either.
   
   It's quite common for a group to collectively see the ultimate desirable outcome.  The disagreement is had in the next step.  Don't be fooled by idealism.  Don't be baited by oversimplified solutions.  You will have a problem tomorrow, that is a certainty.  The choice you have then, is which probem you will have.  Choose the better problem.
