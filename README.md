# Management

This is a repository of things I have found useful in understanding people, their motivations, how they work, and why their contributions are important.

This is broken into the following categories:

1. [Frameworks](https://github.com/Mejeurca/management/blob/master/frameworks.md): structures for thinking about how people approach problems
2. [Reading](https://github.com/Mejeurca/management/blob/master/reading.md): a list of things that are useful to read
3. [Concepts](https://github.com/Mejeurca/management/blob/master/concepts.md): a collection of concepts that are useful in understanding people
4. [Organizational Concepts](https://github.com/Mejeurca/management/blob/master/organizational_concepts.md): a collectino of concepts that are useful in understanding organizations
5. Lessons: a synopsis of hard lessons I've learned
6. Next Steps: a list of things I want to try next

This isn't an all inclusive list of how and why I manage, but it's a wonderful start.  I hope you find this useful and that it makes your work more fruitful.
