# Weaver's Path

All credit for this framework goes to Matthew Weaver, a dear friend and even better thought lord.

1. We tried that already

   The problems you're likely to work on are hard.  Like, unimagineably hard.  Yes, you're smart, and yes, you've solved hard problems before.  Trust me when I say, the problems in government (our clients) are not like the ones you've worked on in the past.  The technical problem may be quite simple, but you will play in a system of unimaginable difficulty.
   
   With that said, lots of smart people have come before you.  Long lines of them.  Some of them were smarter than you are.  The litany of things they attempted is longer than you can imagine.  The dedication they had to solving the problem was pristine.  Every iteration of every solution you can imagine was considered.
   
2. We are the problem

   The problems you find yourself with were the solutions of yesteryear. No one set out to build problems, they are the outcome of adjusting and changing a system over decades.  Seek to understand why your predecessors made those decisions.  Understand the impact of the decisions you make. 
   
   You will create problems for some future iteration of the team dealing with the problem you now work on.

3. There is no bottom

   This cycle goes on forever.  You can keep iterating and changing.  You will not find an end to the problems that need to be solved.  Each problem you find will be worse than the last.  This is the reality of the world we live in.

Well that's pretty dire.

I tell you this not to discourage you or your employees.  I tell you because it's your job to race an employee to accept this framework as soon as possible.
   
   Nothing is more annoying than working with a blindsided idealist convinced that everyone before them was just stupid.  As long as they harbor this mentality, they will not move towards your objectives.  They will continually search out the silver bullets.
   
   We move the system by changing the vector of the path we're on.
