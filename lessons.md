- People are messy

   Life happens.  There are often home circumstances that help explain employee behavior.  This happens to all of us.  Kids get sick, parents die, spouses leave.  People aren't robots.  Create a space that helps employees through difficult times, and the employee will help the company likewise.

- Little needs to happen immediately

   Our tempo in software development often follows the motto "move fast and break things".  This is great for writing code and terrible for managing people.  Gather facts before you make judgement calls.  Sleep on things before you take action.  The only time you should take immediate action is when there is immediate danger.
   
   Rash action instills distrust.
